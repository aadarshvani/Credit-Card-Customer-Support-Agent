# AmEx AI Support Agent
# 🏦 AmEx AI Credit Support Agent

An intelligent customer support system designed specifically for American Express credit card services. This AI-powered agent combines Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), machine learning models, and live web search to provide comprehensive, accurate, and contextually relevant responses to customer queries.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end AI support system that intelligently routes customer queries to appropriate tools, including existing ML models for churn prediction and credit approval, while maintaining high response quality through iterative improvement mechanisms.

**Key Differentiator**: Unlike traditional chatbots, this system integrates multiple specialized tools and models to provide personalized, data-driven responses that can prevent churn and facilitate credit decisions in real-time.
